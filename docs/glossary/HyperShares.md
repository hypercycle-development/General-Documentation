A Hypershare is created by combining a cHYPc NFT and a license of the same level. This combination enhances a nodeâ€™s functionality by enabling interactions with other nodes and performing security checks within the network. Additionally, through the tiling process, both the cHYPc and the license can progressively unlock access to lower levels (below 10) over time without losing value, although this limits further duplication.
