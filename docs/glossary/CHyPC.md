cHYPc is an NFT that represents "frozen" HYPc. Through a swap contract, users exchange HYPc for cHYPc, which locks the original tokens. Like licenses, cHYPc has levels ranging from 10 to 19 and can be split into lower-level versions, with each split halving its value. Through the tiling process (when cHYPc is paired with a license to create a Hypershare and run a node), cHYPc can also unlock levels below 10 over time without reducing its overall value. Lowering its level only limits how many times it can be duplicated, similarly to licenses.
