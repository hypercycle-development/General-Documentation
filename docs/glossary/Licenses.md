Licenses within HyperCycle are NFTs that allow clients to operate computing nodes on the network. Each license has a level, ranging from 10 to 19, which determines its capabilities. Licenses can be manually split into two lower-level licenses (splitting their value in half). Through the tiling process—where a license is combined with cHYPc to form a Hypershare and used to run a node—licenses can progressively unlock access to levels below 10 (9 to 1). This happens over time and allows a level 10 license, for instance, to split into two level 9 licenses without any loss in value. Lowering the level does not affect value but reduces the number of times the NFT can be duplicated.
